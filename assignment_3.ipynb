    "operator ($\\nabla^2$), and the second equation the form for a 2-D\n",
    "cartesian coordinate system that we will use in this assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we consider source/ sink terms, we include them as terms on\n",
    "the right-hand-side and obtain a Poisson equation of the form:\n",

    "where $q$ now denotes the additional source/ sink term in the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "We discussed several possibilities to solve 1-D Laplace equations\n",

    "that we will consider $\\Delta x \\ne \\Delta y$).\n",

    "  using the point values $u_{i,j}^{n}$ from the previous iteration.\n",
    "* The Gauss-Seidel method which is very similar to the Jacobi\n",
    "  method, but makes use of information on grid points that have been\n",
    "  updated previously (and often leads to faster convergence).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use any one of these solvers in this exercise. However, it is\n",
    "instructive to implement and compare both - the difference in code\n",
    "that you have to write is actually really small (only changes in one\n",
    "or two lines of code!).\n",
    "\n",
    "As convergence criterium, we will use the L2-norm:\n",
